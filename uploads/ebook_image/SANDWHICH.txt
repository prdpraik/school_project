sandwhich and hh package for R and lmtest


SST=RSS+SSE
SST--total sum
RSS--Regression Squared sum
SSE--Squared sum of errors

ss  | df
RSS | k
SSE | n-k-1
____________
SST | n-1
MSS
MSR = RSS/k
MSE = SSE/n-k-1

R^2 = RSS/SST
adjusted R^2 = 1-MSE/MST



k-- no of variables 
n-- sample siz

we need to calculate hypothesis test to predict on population but not on sample

H0 -- b1=0
h1 -- b1!=0
